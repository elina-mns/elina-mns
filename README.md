# Hi, I'm Elina!👋

I am an iOS developer based in Toronto, ON. I have my working experience in a start-up, where I had multiple projects handling deadlines, interacting with clients and planning technical implementations. My daily tasks included developing complex UI, building user interaction logic with an application, storing/caching data in CoreData, Realm. 

My skills include: Xcode, Swift, Java, SwiftUI, Git, Github, Jira, Postman, CoreData, Realm, CocoaPods.

My hobby is to discover new music equipment, I also appreciate nature, philosophy and art.
